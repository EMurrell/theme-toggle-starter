# Theme Toggle Starter

## This is a Nextjs(13) Starter pre-configured with dark/light mode switch (no flash) and Animation components.


### It uses the following packages/dependencies:

* [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling, 
* [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for the animations, 
* [react-intersection-observer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-intersection-observer) for triggering animations on scroll, 
* [next-themes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-themes) for controlling the dark/light mode toggle

## How to use:
* clone the repository,
* run `npm i` to install the dependencies
* import the `Toggle` and `animation` components into whichever file you want to use them
* Wrap JSX elements with an animation component for scroll-triggered animations
* Customize the animation components to your liking (set delay, duration, etc)

Run `npm run dev` to start the development server, and view at `localhost:3000`
