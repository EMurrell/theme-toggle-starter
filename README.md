# theme-toggle-starter

## This is a Nextjs(13) Starter pre-configured with Theme switch and Animation components.

### It uses the following packages/dependencies:

* TailwindCSS for styling, 
* Framer Motion for the animations, 
* react-intersection-observer for triggering animations on scroll, 
* next-themes for controlling the dark/light mode toggle

## How to use:
* clone the repository,
* run `npm i` to install the dependencies
* import the `Toggle` and `animation` components into whichever file you want to use them
* Wrap JSX elements with an animation component for scroll-triggered animations
* Customize the animation components to your liking (set delay, duration, etc)

Run `npm run dev` to start the development server, and view at `localhost:3000`
